      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Abbie Finnimore! I grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and later moved to New Jersey. 
        I am in my second year of computer engineering at Rowan University in New Jersey. I work part time at 
        a coffee shop while going to University. 
        
      <br>
        Right now, I have not much experience in coding yet, but I am currently learning to 
        improve my skills. I have experiance in Python and a little bit of javascript, and I am
        looking forward to learning more languages in the future.

        In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, taking pictures, and exploring new places. I also enjoy reading books, and like to 
        document my reads through reviewing every book I read. 
      </br>

      <p>
      <br>
        My favorite genres of music include alternative, rock, pop punk, and kpop. I love discovering new artists
        and attending live concerts, since my music taste is always evolving.
